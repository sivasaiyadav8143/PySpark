# PySpark
PySpark is a Spark library written in Python to run Python application using Apache Spark capabilities, using PySpark we can run applications parallelly
on the distributed cluster (multiple nodes).<br>
Pyspark is alternative to mapreduce in Hadoop.<br>
# Features
1. In-memory computation
2. Distributed processing using parallelize
3. Can be used with many cluster managers (Spark, Yarn, Mesos e.t.c)
4. Fault-tolerant
5. Lazy evaluation
6. Cache & persistence
7. Inbuild-optimization when using DataFrames
# Advantages
1.  PySpark can process data from Hadoop HDFS, AWS S3, and many file systems.
2. It is a in-memory, distributed processing engine that allows you to process data efficiently in a distributed fashion.
3. Applications running on PySpark are 100x faster than traditional systems.
4. It also is used to process real-time data using Streaming and Kafka.
# Architecture
Apache Spark works in a master-slave architecture where the master is called “Driver” and slaves are called “Workers”. When you run a Spark application, Spark Driver creates a context that is an entry point to your application,
and all operations (transformations and actions) are executed on worker nodes, and the resources are managed by Cluster Manager.
